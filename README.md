# Sales-Forecasting-Predicting-Future-Sales-Based-on-Historical-Data

In this mini project of Sales Forecasting, we are predicting future sales of the Maruti Suzuki company based on its historical data of last 11.5 years, i.e., 138 months, using simple linear regression model of machine learning.
Linear regression is a fundamental statistical method used in Machine Learning and Data Science to make predictions. Regression analysis is a technique used to understand the relationships among variables. It allows us to make predictions about one variable based on the values of another variable. Linear regression specifically seeks to model this relationship with a straight line, known as the "best fit line."
The best fit line, also known as regression line, is the line which passes through mid of the scatter plot, it minimizes the sum of the squared differences between the observed values and the values predicted by the line. This best fit line, i.e., regression line is of very significance in making predictions.
Linear regression is not only effective in sales forecasting, but in all the scenarios where prediction needs to be made. Its application is vast, can be used in Stock Market Forecasting, Risk Management, Health Care and Marketing.
In this project we collect the time series sales (domestic) of the Maruti Suzuki company for previous 138 months, and predict the sales for the 139th month, i.e., July 2024, based on the regression line or best fit line between the scatterplot of months vs sales. 

Output :

























Predited sales for the 139th month




















Scatterplot months vs sales along with Regression Line or best fit line
